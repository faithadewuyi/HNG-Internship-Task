# HNG-Internship-Task
This repository contains the code for HNG internship first project which is to create a personal web page. 
The task was to develop and host a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that showcases specific personal and real-time data attributes. Each required element is marked with a data-testid attribute for easy identification and testing.

One of the most exciting aspects of this project was designing the user interface. I took special care to create an intuitive and visually appealing layout, ensuring that the user experience is both informative and engaging.

What I've Learned:

Throughout the development process, I gained valuable experience in:

    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: I honed my skills in these core web development technologies, using them to structure, style, and add interactivity to the web page.
    Flexbox and Layouts: I explored different layout techniques to achieve the desired visual design and responsiveness.
    Test-Driven Development (TDD): I learned the importance of marking elements with data-testid attributes for efficient testing, which contributed to a more robust and reliable application.
